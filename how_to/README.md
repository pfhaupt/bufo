# Language Features
This directory describes what is possible in bufo, what is not, and showcases features using complete and standalone code examples.

## Contributions
An important part of this documentation are the examples. All of them should compile as they are without requiring extra code, unless mentioned otherwise. If an example doesn't work, feel free to create an Issue on Github or submit a Pull Request.
