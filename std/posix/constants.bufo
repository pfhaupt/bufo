/*
Constants used in POSIX

Besides constants using opaque structures in windows.h (for example
INVALID_HANDLE uses `Handle`) where we need to provide *some*
representation of the underlying data, all constants are taken from
the official Microsoft documentation.

Usage of any of these constants is moderately unsafe and might destroy
your system if not treated carefully.
